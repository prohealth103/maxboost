       Welcome to The Max Boost Plus!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       These terms and conditions outline the rules and regulations for the use of Max Boost Plus’s Website.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       By using this website, you are agreeing to abide by these terms and conditions. If you do not agree to all the terms and conditions outlined on this page, please refrain from using Max Boost Plus.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       The Terms and Conditions, Privacy Statement, and Disclaimer Notice as well as any Agreements mentioned here use specific terminology. In this context, “Client”, “You”, and “Your” are terms that refer to the individual visiting this website and agreeing to the Company’s terms and conditions. On the other hand, references such as “The Company”, “Ourselves”, “We”, “Our”, and “Us” are all directed towards the Company itself. Additionally, the wordings “Party”, “Parties”, or “Us” indicate both the Client and the Company together. These terms encompass the agreement, acknowledgment, and exchange of payment essential for providing assistance to the Client in a manner that aligns with the Client’s requirements related to the Company’s services, within the framework of the applicable laws of the Netherlands. It is important to note that the use of these terms in singular or plural form, with capital letters or not, and the interchangeability of gender-specific pronouns like he/she or they, implies the same references throughout.
